<h3>Details</h3>
<div class="paper">
  We propose a general vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces formulation for the problem of learning an unknown functional dependency between a structured input space and a structured output space, in the Semi-Supervised Learning setting. In the case of least square loss function, we provide a closed form solution with an efficient implementation. Numerical experiments on challenging multi-class categorization problems show that our multi-view learning formulation achieves results which are comparable with state of the art and are significantly better than single-view learning. <br> <br>
