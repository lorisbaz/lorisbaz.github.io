<div class="publication__item"><p>
I am an AI Research Leader with 15+ years of experience advancing AI, from classical computer vision and machine learning to today’s foundation and multimodal generative models. My core strength lies in driving innovation: developing new models that push the state of the art and translating them into real-world products at global scale.
<br><br>
As Principal Scientist at <a href="http://www.amazon.jobs/location/berlin-germany">Amazon</a>, I led high-impact core research and product efforts across Prime Video, Alexa, and mobile/.com shopping. I co-developed novel models and architectures for video understanding, vision-language representation, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), and diffusion models. My work powered AI-driven features such as live sports highlights, virtual try-on, interactive product recommendations, and shopping assistants, used by millions of users worldwide and generating O(XXM) USD in business impact. I pioneered Amazon’s first deep learning models for video understanding and LMM-based shopping experiences, laying the foundation for new product directions and research programs across the company.
<br><br>
My research has been published in top-tier venues including CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and ICML, with contributions spanning vision-language training, video understanding, generative models, and LMMs. I’ve authored 50+ publications and granted patents, and actively serve the scientific community as a reviewer and workshop organizer.
<br><br>
I thrive in fast-paced, cross-functional environments, collaborating with scientists, engineers, and product leaders to turn foundational research into scalable solutions. My goal is to build AI systems that are both technically groundbreaking and product-relevant.
<br><br>
I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.di.univr.it/">University of Verona</a> (Italy) in 2012 supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=92">Vittorio Murino</a> and Prof. <a href="http://profs.sci.univr.it/~cristanm/">Marco Cristani</a>.
During my Ph.D., I visited the <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a> collaborating with Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/">Nando de Freitas</a>.
Before Amazon, I was a postdoctoral fellow at <a href="http://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth College</a> working with Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~lorenzo/home.html">Lorenzo Torresani</a> and I was a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://pavis.iit.it/">Italian Institute of Technology</a> working with Prof. <a href="https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=92">Vittorio Murino</a>.</span>
